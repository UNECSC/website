### **Project Goals**

1. **Security-Driven Design**  
   Security is at the core of our clubâ€™s mission and values. We aim to implement best practices in secure web design, including code obfuscation, minimal data exposure, and strong access controls.

2. **Embedded Capture-The-Flag (CTF) Challenges**  
   For those who like a challenge, the website will contain hidden CTF challenges throughout, encouraging users to explore the site while honing their problem-solving skills.

3. **Super Cookies for Educational Workshops**  
   As a learning tool, we will demonstrate advanced cookie functionalities and tracking concepts in a secure and ethical manner, using "super cookies" as case studies for security demonstrations in workshops.

### **Technical Requirements**

To maintain a high standard of security and performance, the following technical practices are implemented:

- **Secure Code Obfuscation**  
   All critical frontend code will be obfuscated to add a layer of security, ensuring sensitive logic is protected from tampering and misuse.

- **Server-Side Data Protection**  
   Sensitive user interactions and data are managed server-side, with secure data validation, encryption, and access control mechanisms in place.

- **Compliance with Privacy Standards**  
   We are committed to meeting privacy regulations and standards. Cookie use is transparent, limited to functional and educational purposes, and users are informed of their usage.

- **CTF Integration**  
   CTF challenges will be subtly embedded within the website, encouraging members to test their skills while also protecting the integrity and functionality of the platform.
